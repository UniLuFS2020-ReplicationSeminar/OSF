Data Mining Class Exercise 1 for Olga, Simon and Fabian

## Introduction
In our project we want to evaluate the relationship between the macro economy of countries and political systems. In our operationalisation we use variables which convey information about the unemployment, type of cabinet and time. We then go on to compare unemployment over time between countries with a cabinet which has been mostly conservative versus countries with a cabinet which has been mostly socialist.
We assume, that if time has a bigger impact on the unemployment than the type of cabinet, then there must be other factors which are more important in determining the unemployment rate of a country.

Research Question:
To what extent does the type of cabinet affect the unemployment in a country over time?

Hypothesis:
The type of cabinet is not enough to explain unemployment.
